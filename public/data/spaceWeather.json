This CME is not currently visible in STEREO A COR2 due to an ongoing data gap beginning at 2026-01-15T16:23Z. The source of this event is a filament eruption seen in SDO AIA and GOES SUVI 304 centered at approximately N55W30 with liftoff beginning at approx. 2026-01-15T22:06Z. It appears a majority of this material fell back down, but some fully erupted.",
